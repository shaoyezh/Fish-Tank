# Step 1
Code affected: none
Created this file.

#########
# Step 2
Code affected: all .java files
Reformatted using the Google Java style formatter.

#########
# Step 3
Code affected: Fish.turnAround
Flaw: unnecessary if, leading to duplicate code.
Fix: replaced if statement with a single assignment statement.

#########
# Step 4
Created new super class: Item.java.
Code affected:Bubble.java, Fish.java, Hungry Fish.java, Seaweed.java
Flaw: inconsistent coordinate system
Fix: create method "setLocation" in Item.java. Let other class inherit this method.
Also fix other relevant code.

#########
# Step 5
Created new child class: Fishes.java.
Code affected:Fish.java, HungryFish.java, Fishes.java, FishTankManager.java
Flaw: Both class has similar move() turnaround() lead to duplicate code. Fishes swim outside of the
FishTank
Fix: create a subclass Fishes that inherit Item, then make Fish and HungryFish inherit Fishes's
method.Make GridHeight and GridWidth be private static, then add setter and getter.

#########
# Step 6
Improve the description in Step 5
Code affected: Bubble.java, Fishes.java, FishTankManage.java, Seaweed.java, Item.java
Flaw: waste of time looping the 2D array myLittleFishes. This ArrayList also causes
many duplicate code in FishTankManage.java.
Fix: Create a private ArrayList to replace the 2D ArrayList. Transfer the method blowBubble to the
     body of method update.
     Create abstract method move in Item to decrease the number of casting in update.

#########
# Step 7
Fix the grammar mistake in Step 6 description
Code affected: Bubble.java, Fishes.java, FishTankManage.java, Item.java, Seaweed.java
Flaw: gridWidth and gridHeight in FishTankManager should not be static.
Fix: Change gridWidth and gridHeight to non-static. Adding 2 more parameter in method move.

#########
# Step 8
Code affected: Fishes.java
Flaw: Fishes do not move correctly. They don't turnaround after bump into wall cause. Swim backward.
Also, bubbles are created at negative height.
Fix: force fishes to turnaround after bump into wall. Fix the bug that fishes can swim to negative
height.

#########
# Step 9
Code affected: Fishes.java, FishTankManager.java
Flaw: Bubble object still exists in memory even it goes out of the FishTank. No documentation explain
what Fishes do when they bump the wall.
Fix: Set bubble object to null when it goes to the surface or bump into wall, and garbage collect it.
Adding documentation for fishes' move.

#########
# Step 10
Create new item class: shrimp.java
Code affected: Fishes.java, Fish.java, HungryFish.java
Flaw: reverseAppearance can be inheritance from Fishes class
Fix: Let reverseAppearance take one String parameter. Make this method work independent the
appearance attribute.

#########
# Step 11
Code affected: Shrimp.java, FishTankManager.java, Item.java
Flaw: Many duplicate code in draw method of FishTankManager and many casting
Fix: Create an abstract method in Item class. Complete the Shrimp class.

#########
# Step 12
Code affected: Fish.java, Fishes.java, FishTankManager.java, HungryFish.java,
Seaweed.java,Shrimp.java
Flaw: Code smell in Seaweed.java. Dispensable instance variable leanRight. Also, many useless
comment in other file.
Fix: Merge leanRight and lR into one instance variable lR. Delete meaningless documentation make
program looks cleaner.

#########
# Step 13
Code affected: Bubble.java, Fish.java, FishTankManager.java, Item.java, Seaweed.java
Flaw: Code smell: the action of blow bubble should be completed in Fishes class
Fix: add one more parameter to move. Pass the ArrayList myLittleFishes to the move method.
